		/// No longer recommended. This supports an older ID-based format for

		/// Most eBay categories no longer support ID-based attributes.
		/// The remaining categories (e.g., US eBay Motors) will drop support
		/// for ID-based attributes by May 2012.
		/// New applications should not use ID-based attributes.
		/// Existing applications should be updated to remove all dependencies
		/// on ID-based attributes now. Instead, use FindProducts in
		/// eBay's Shopping API to search for product details.
		/// 
		/// Searches for Pre-filled Item Information within one or more characteristic sets.
		/// This kind of search is only applicable in the context of the Sell Your Item use
		/// case. Use the response to present the seller with a list of products found in a
		/// catalog. (For buy-side searches, use the <a
		/// href="http://www.developer.ebay.com/DevZone/finding/CallRef/index.html"
		/// >Finding API</a>.)
		/// 
		/// See the Attributes and Catalogs section of the eBay Web Services guide for
		/// background information and terminology definitions, as well as information about
		/// how to use this call in the Sell Your Item flow.
		/// 
		/// You can use this call to search for different products at the same time. That is,
		/// this call can perform batch searches.
		/// 
		/// Given an array of ProductSearch properties that are configured with a list of
		/// search attributes or keywords (and other information), GetProductSearchResults
		/// searches an eBay catalog for products that match each query. Some queries can be
		/// configured to also specify a sort order for the results.
		/// 
		/// To configure a ProductSearch object to search by attributes, you need a valid
		/// combination of search attributes. If you want to use a sort order other than the
		/// default order, you also need a valid sort attribute. We offer two calls that
		/// return product search and sort attributes. Use GetCategory2CS to determine which
		/// one of these calls you can use for a given category. At least one approach is
		/// offered for each catalog-enabled category, and some cases, both are
		/// offered.
		/// 
		/// <b>GetProductSearchPage</b>: Use this call when you want to configure
		/// a simple query that consists of a single search attribute (with a value). This
		/// retrieves a single product or a very short list of search results to choose from.
		/// Some products are fairly easy to find based on a single attribute. For example, in
		/// Consumer Electronics categories (Digital Cameras, Cell Phones, and PDAs), you can
		/// specify a unique (or nearly unique) identifier, like a part number. In Media
		/// categories (Books, DVDs &amp; Movies, Music, and Video Games), you can specify a
		/// descriptive name, like a title. 
		/// 
		/// <b>GetProductFinder</b>: Use this call when you want to configure a
		/// complex query. In the Sell Your Item flow, this is a complex query against the
		/// eBay product catalog. Currently, this type of search is available in Consumer
		/// Electronics categories only. In this type of search, you specify values for
		/// multiple attributes, like Brand and Resolution (i.e., number of megapixels). This
		/// retrieves a list of matching products. This approach is useful when the user does
		/// not know the part number, or a product does not have a single, distinguishing
		/// feature that is easy to search on. For example, searching for a digital camera
		/// based solely on the brand would likely yield far too many results to be useful.
		/// Searching on the brand, product line, and resolution will retrieve a much shorter
		/// list of results. 
		/// 
		/// Alternatively, you can search on a particular keyword that appears in a product's
		/// title or Item Specifics. For this, you use GetProductSearchResults and and pass in
		/// one or more text strings (with optional wildcards) in ProductSearch.QueryKeywords.
		/// 
		/// 
		/// When you use a keyword query, the search criteria are not restricted to the
		/// results of a product search page or product finder, so the criteria are not tied
		/// to a particular characteristic set. This means you can search across multiple
		/// characteristic sets using the same query. This is useful when the user wants to
		/// broaden their search across multiple categories. For example, a seller who sells
		/// Jazz books, Jazz CDs, and Jazz movies may want to search for "Bird" across
		/// multiple categories. Specify the characteristic set IDs of interest by using
		/// CharacteristicSetIDs. 
		/// 
		/// GetProductSearchResults returns a list of matching products, if any. Each product
		/// is represented as a list of attributes (Item Specifics) plus other identifying
		/// information, such as a product ID and a stock photo. 
		/// 
		/// Once the user selects a product from the list (this may require a call to
		/// GetProductFamilyMembers to retrieve additional products to choose from), pass its
		/// ID in a GetProductSellingPages request to retrieve more detailed information about
		/// each product, including a set of optional Item Specifics that the seller can use
		/// in addition to the pre-filled Item Specifics (see GetProductSellingPages).
		/// 
		/// 
		/// To use this data in a listing, pass the product ID and the optional Item Specifics
		/// in the seller's listing request (AddItem).
