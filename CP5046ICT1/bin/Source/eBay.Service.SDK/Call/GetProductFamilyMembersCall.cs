		/// No longer recommended. This supports an older ID-based format for
		/// describing item specifics and product details.
		/// Most eBay categories no longer support ID-based attributes.
		/// The remaining categories (e.g., US eBay Motors) will drop support
		/// for ID-based attributes by May 2012.
		/// New applications should not use ID-based attributes.
		/// Existing applications should be updated to remove all dependencies
		/// on ID-based attributes now. Instead, use FindProducts in
		/// eBay's Shopping API to search for product details.
		/// 
		/// GetProductFamilyMembers is intended to be used combination with GetProductSearchResults.
		/// If a search result returned from GetProductSearchResults does not return all
		/// product versions in a family, and if the user wants to see more versions (editions)
		/// of the product, you can use GetProductFamilyMembers to retrieve all versions of the product.
		/// That is, if GetProductSearchResultsonly returns the product family header (ParentProduct),
		/// use this call to zoom in on a particular family of product versions.
		/// (This situation usually occurs when you call GetProductSearchResults and more more
		/// matches are found than the MaxChildrenPerFamily value you specified.)
		/// 
		/// The structure of tGetProductFamilyMembers is similar to that of GetProductSearchResults.
		/// Instead of passing in a query, you pass in a product ID. This product ID is used to
		/// find all the members of the product family that the specified product is a member of.
		/// The results are compatible with the results from GetProductSearchResults,
		/// so similar application logic can be used to handle both requests and responses.
		/// This call supports batch requests. This means you can retrieve products in
		/// multiple families by using a single request. To perform a batch request,
		/// pass an array of ProductSearch objects in the call.
		/// 
		/// For each ProductSearch object, GetProductFamilyMembers returns a list of all the
		/// products in the specified product family. Each product is represented as a list of
		/// attributes (Item Specifics) plus other identifying information, such as a product ID
		/// and a stock photo.
		/// 
		/// Once the user selects a product from the results, pass its ID in a GetProductSellingPages
		/// request to retrieve more detailed information about the product, including a set of
		/// optional Item Specifics that the seller can use in addition to the
		/// pre-filled Item Specifics (see GetProductSellingPages).
